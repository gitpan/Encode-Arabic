Encode/Arabic/ArabTeX version 1.39                 2005/07/20 21:55:47
==================================

Perl extension for multi-purpose processing of the ArabTeX notation of
Arabic

ArabTeX is an excellent extension to TeX/LaTeX designed for
typesetting the right-to-left scripts of the Orient. It comes up with
very intuitive and comprehensible lower ASCII transliterations, the
expressive power of which is even better than that of the scripts.

Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX implements the rules needed for proper
interpretation of the ArabTeX notation of Arabic. The conversion
ifself is done by Encode::Mapper, and the user interface is built on
the Encode::Encoding module.
