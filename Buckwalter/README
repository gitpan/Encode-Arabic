Encode/Arabic/Buckwalter version 1.09              2004/08/22 23:44:05
=====================================

Perl extension for Tim Buckwalter's transliteration of Arabic

Tim Buckwalter's notation is a one-to-one transliteration of the
Arabic script for Modern Standard Arabic, using lower ASCII characters
to encode the graphemes of the original script. This system has been
very popular in Natural Language Processing, however, there are limits
to its applicability due to numerous non-alphabetic codes involved.
